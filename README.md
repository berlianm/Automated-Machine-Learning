This repository is dedicated to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning for breast cancer classification tasks. The goal of this repository is to showcase the application of automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques using TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool) to build an optimal classification model for breast cancer diagnosis.
